free -m -----to check the RAM size
Memory:
The information displayed in the memory section provides the same data about memory usage as the command free -m.
The swapd or “swapped” column reports how much memory has been swapped out to a swap file or disk. 
The free column reports the amount of unallocated memory. 
The buff or “buffers” column reports the amount of allocated memory in use.
 The cache column reports the amount of allocated memory that could be swapped to disk or unallocated
 if the resources are needed for another task.
swpd: the amount of virtual memory used.
free: the amount of idle memory.
buff: the amount of memory used as buffers.
cache: the amount of memory used as cache.
inact: the amount of inactive memory. (-a option)
active: the amount of active memory. (-a option)

cat /proc/meminfo------to check ram details
df -h-------disk free size in human readable formate
du -h-------disk usage

CPU
The cpu section reports on the use of the system’s CPU resources. 
The columns in this section always add to 100 and reflect “percentage of available time”.
The us column reports the amount of time that the processor spends on userland tasks, or all non-kernel processes. 
Top----
sar------to check the cpu utilization
Sar is part of the sysstat package.
following Linux performance statistics using sar.
Collective CPU usage
Individual CPU statistics
Memory used and available
Swap space used and available
Overall I/O activities of the system
Individual device I/O activities
Context switch statistics
Run queue and load average data
Network statistics
Report sar data from a specific time
Install Sysstat Package
yum install sysstat
the following gives the system CPU statistics 3 times (with 1 second interval).
 sar 1 3
ps---------------to check the processor details
ps -ef--------

Swap:
The swap section reports the rate that memory is sent to or retrieved from the swap system.
 By reporting “swapping” separately from total disk activity, vmstat allows you to determine 
how much disk activity is related to the swap system.
The si column reports the amount of memory that is moved from swap to “real” memory per second. 
The so column reports the amount of memory that is moved to swap from “real” memory per second.
si: Amount of memory swapped in from disk (/s).
so: Amount of memory swapped to disk (/s).

How to Monitor Linux Systems Performance with iostat command
iostat command generally generates two reports:
1.CPU utilization report
2.All disks i/o statistics report
To generate the reports, iostat command reads some of the system files . 
These files are,
/proc/diskstats for disk stats
/proc/stat for system stats
/sys for block device stats
/proc/devices for persistent device names
/proc/self/mountstats for all  the network filesystems
/proc/uptime for information regarding system uptime
Iostat Installation on Linux Systems
ostat is a part of ‘sysstat‘ package, we can install it on our system using the following command
CentOS/RedHat
# yum install sysstat -y
Ubuntu/Debian
# apt-get install sysstat -y
Get complete statistics (CPU & Devices)
# iostat
Generate only CPU stats
# iostat -c
To Generate i/o statistics for all the devices (-d option) 
# iostat -d

vmsat:
vmstat – Report virtual memory statistics. vmstat is a tool that collects and reports data about 
your system’s memory, swap, and processor resource utilization in real time.
It can be used to determine the root cause of performance and issues related to memory use.
iostat reports CPU, disk I/O, and NFS statistics.
vmstat reports virtual memory statistics.
mpstat reports processors statictics.

How to install vmstat?
1. Ensure you are logged in as ‘root’
‘iostat’ and ‘vmstat’ are apart of the ‘sysstat’ package and should be installed by default
2. Verify installation :
# rpm -qa | grep -i sysstat
3. Installation, if needed :
# rpm -ivh <name>
4. If you have connectivity to RHN or a Satellite Server:
# yum install sysstat
5. If you are using Ubantu:
# apt-get install sysstat
Most important fields are free under memory and si, so under swap column.
# vmstat -a
Disks Statistics, vmstat with -d option display all disks statistics.
 vmstat -d

Network Configuration
1. ifconfig Command
ifconfig is a command line interface tool for network interface configuration and also
 used to initialize an interfaces at system boot time
ifconfig
Ping Command
ping (Packet INternet Groper) is a utility normally used for testing connectivity between two systems
 on a network (Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN)).
Netstat Command
netstat is a command line tool that displays useful information such as network connections, routing tables, 
interface statistics, and much more, concerning the Linux networking subsystem
$ sudo netstat -tnlp
